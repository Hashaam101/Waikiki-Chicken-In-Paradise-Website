# Sun Tea Mix Website

This site was built for the client **Sun Tea Mix** using TableTurnerr's Client Site Structure & Design. It is a modern, responsive web app built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Features & Sections

- **Animated Header & Navigation**: Smooth navigation with animated buttons and section scrolling.
- **Menu & Reviews**: Interactive menu cards, drag-to-scroll, and customer reviews.
- **FAQ & Story**: Dynamic FAQ section and brand story.
- **Location & Contact**: Easy access to location info and call-to-action buttons.
- **Instagram Feed**: Displays recent Instagram posts and reels in a grid or carousel layout.

## Instagram Feed Section

For managing and displaying Instagram media, we recommend using the [Insta-Thumbnails-Importer](https://github.com/Hashaam101/Insta-Thumbnails-Importer) tool:

> **Insta-Thumbnails-Importer** is a Python script for downloading Instagram post thumbnails as `.jpg` images and reels as `.gif` files (first 5 seconds, looped). It clears the output directory before each run, shows progress bars, and outputs a TypeScript file with post metadata for easy integration. No login required for public posts/reels.

See the tool's repo for setup and usage instructions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
